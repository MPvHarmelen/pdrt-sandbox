============

Synopsis
--------
[(Projective) Discourse Representation
Theory](http://hbrouwer.github.io/pdrt-sandbox/)

Description
-----------

This is an implementation of the formal framework of Projective Discourse
Representation Theory (Venhuizen et al. 2013; 2014), which is an extension
of standard Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981; Kamp & Reyle 1993)
with projection pointers.

The implementation includes a translation from PDRT to DRT and First-order
Logic, composition via different types of merge, and unresolved structures
based on Montague Semantics, defined as Haskell functions.
