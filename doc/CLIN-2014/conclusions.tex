\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

%So, instead of physically moving semantic material on the representation
%level to the context of interpretation, as in
%\possessivecite{sandt1992presupposition} account, projection is realized in
%PDRT by setting a variable equation between pointers and context labels.
%This allows for a compositional treatment of projection phenomena that does
%not assume a two-stage resolution algorithm.  Moreover, the resulting
%semantic representation stays close to the linguistic surface structure,
%making it easy to evaluate.  Only at the interpretation stage, i.e., when
%providing a model-theoretic interpretation of the representation
%structures, the content needs to be moved to its accommodation site in
%order to obtain the desired interpretation.
