%Moreover, projected contexts may
%subordinate other projected contexts, which happens for example in the case
%of embedded presuppositions. So, in order to properly define the projection
%path of projected content in PDRT, the subordination properties of projected
%contexts should be explicitly part of the PDRS. We do this by enhancing each
%PDRS with a set of \MAPs: Minimally Accessible Projected contexts, which are
%basically tuples describing pairs of  subordinating contexts.
