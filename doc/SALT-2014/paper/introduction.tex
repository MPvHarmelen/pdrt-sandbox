  \textbf{Challenge:} & CIs provide \textit{new} information, but they
                        project as if providing \textit{old} information
                        (like presuppositions).\\

   \textbf{Solution:} & CIs provide \textit{new} information to the
                        (projecting) context created by a presupposition,
                        namely the one provided by its anchor.\\

\textbf{Implementation:} & CIs are projection-anaphoric in the sense that
                        they inherit their projection context from their
                        (projecting) anchor. This is formalized in PDRT
                        \citep{venhuizen2013iwcs} by introducing a dependency
                        at the lexical level between the projection site of
                        the CI and the projection site of the anchor.
